At AFRY IT South you can get paid to deepen your competence, either through talking a course, joining a competence group or really do whatever you feel like could help broaden competence (perhaps discussing a youtube-clip about how to make great presentations?).

- Max 2h / Month / Group
- Max 2 groups / Month (free to join more, but the paid time maxes at 4h)

Here are the current competence groups, but please not you don't need to be in a competence group to actually work on your competence!
