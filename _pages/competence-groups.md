At AFRY IT South you get paid to grow your competence, which can be done in a few different ways.

- Competence Groups
- Courses (Coursera etc)
- Discussion nights (perhaps discussing a youtube-clip about how to make great presentations?)

You name it, ask us and we'll help.  
There's some rules attached to how you can be paid.  
- Max 2h per activity, per month
- Max 4h in total, per month

## Competence Groups

Here are the current competence groups, but please not you don't need to be in a competence group to actually work on your competence!

### Machine Learning
Our Machine Learning group is run by Hampus Londögård and has previously mainly focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), now moving into all (image, tabular & more).

You can find most of the previous competence evenings at our [GitHub](https://github.com/afry-south/nlp-competence).

See the [Slack Group](https://buitsouth.slack.com/archives/CPMRY5JBZ) for more information.

### Bokcirkeln
The Bokcirkel is run by Fredrik Strandin and currently we're reading "Clean Code". See the [Slack Group](https://buitsouth.slack.com/archives/C010WHF80RF) for more information.

A new book will be initiated in January, make sure to join in!

### Algorithms
The Algorithm group is run by Linus Röman & Carl Ekerot.  
Historically the evenings has mainly been about doing really fun and challenging coding games were you compete against each-other.  
See the [Slack Group](https://buitsouth.slack.com/archives/CPE14G5LH) for more information.

### Front-End
The Front-End group is run by Nguyen Lam.  
In the Front-End group you'll learn how to develop Webapps, webpages & much more. If you're interested make sure to join the [Slack Group](https://buitsouth.slack.com/archives/CTHPYKDDG) and join the others!

### Computer Security
The Computer Security group is run by Lars Korduner and has a wide array of focuses. Currently there's no recurring meetings but once in a while a funnier event will happen!  

Right now the greatest focus is on good discussions in the [Slack Group](https://buitsouth.slack.com/archives/C01BK2EBNF8) and to share different tools / articles / podcasts etc that are good. A curated home of content that is!
