In the Algorithm & Problem Solving competence group we put our heads together to solve familiar problems. If you enjoy competitive programming and puzzles, this is the group for you.  
We work in small teams where we iteratively work towards solutions through discussion. In previous gatherings we've solved various interactive puzzles, such as a zombie-themed survival simulator or finding an efficient algorithm for solving Minesweeper.  
No preparations or prior knowledge is needed, not even programming! If this sounds like a fun way to spend an evening a month, make sure to join #competence_algorithms_problem_solving on the BU IT South Slack, or reach out to Carl Ekerot or Linus RÃ¶man.
