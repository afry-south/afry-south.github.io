Tipsrundan is the internal newsletter filled with great tips for competence, and other, at AFRY IT South.

Tipsrundan reaches your mailbox once every second week, on Tuesdays. 

If you learned, read or watched anything cool lately make sure to share it and we'll share it to our whole BU (IT South)!  
This can be anything from a short-cut on your computer to a TED-talk or a podcast.

Reach out to Hampus Londögård to share tips.
