# Hackathon 2021 @ AFRY IT South

## General Information

### Format

We'll kick off with a introduction event (~ 30 minutes) where we go through how it all works.

After that we'll have a event together for 3-6 hours.

If you want you can take some time during the weekend (on yourself) to really build a beautiful beast!

Sunday night will be a deadline and Monday the winner will be selected!

### Project

To simplify the process there's some project draft with information & other things ready.

1. Your own idea!
2. Competence Group Related Idea
    - MachineLearning + Streamlit (CoViD? Search?)
3. Magic the Gathering (Anders Hagsten)
    - Bulk data found through [scryfall.com](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data)
4. PWA Game (fritz2, svelte or react?)
5. 

### Price(s)

## Categories

I'll list some different categories with ideas and potential repositories set up.

1. [JVM](#JVM)
2. [Front End](#Front_End)
3. [Algorithms](#Algorithms)
4. [Machine Learning](#Machine_Learning)
5. [Continious Integration / Automation](#Continious_Integration_/_Automation)
6. [Random](#Random)

### JVM
- Learn more about the JVM. 
	- What is a garbage collector? What differentiate [ZGC](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/zgc/Main) (The Z Garbage Collector), [Shenandoa GC](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/shenandoah/Main), [G1 GC](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/g1gc.html) (Garbage First Garbage Collector Tuning) & others?
	- How does the Java Module system work (Jigsaw)?
	- What is "java scripting"?
	- How you can bundle a "native application" using Javas new bundling system which can end up with a ~25mb application (including the whole JVM)

### Front End
- Build your own Progressive Web App (PWA)
	- Learn how to build a PWA that is runnable as both a application and web page (yes, it can run on essentially an OS including iOS, Linux & Windows)
	- Learn how to create a native feel with PWAs (take a photo? using the file-system? notifications? you got it!)
	- How do you actually deploy the end-result on different stores, i.e. Windows App Store & Android Play Store
	- How can you deploy/serve a PWA freely through GitHub?
	- What does it mean to be "offline first"

### Algorithms
- Implement Byte-Piece Encoding
	- I (Hampus) would be happy if you did it on the JVM using pure Java, Scala or Kotlin. Preferably Java or Kotlin to keep interopability at max.
	- Build your own custom variant once you learned how BPE works
### Machine Learning
- Join a Kaggle Competition
- Create end-2-end solution and deploy on a cloud provider (azure/aws/gcp)

### Continious Integration / Automation
- Afry-South + Tipsrundan + Email-Generation is in need of CI!
	- Learn how to make a CI system (using GitHub Actions) that's fully free for your open source projects (and actually free the first X thousand minutes on your private ones!)
	- Knowledge is usable in a lot of other CI systems too

### Random
- Magic The Gathering
	- Make some ML model based on data?
	- [https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data)
- Some kind of Open Source Library (afry-south)
- SQL (databas) Murder Mystery##
