Welcome to our second interview where Carlos Velasco (see image above) is in the spotlight!


## Meet Carlos
### Hi Carlos, tell me quickly about yourself
My name is Carlos, born 1984 in Honduras.  
Built my first website in 1998 and became a web designer in 2006.
Studied Interactive Design, Game Development and Sound Design in the United States and after a year of work,
I returned for freelance & teaching graphic design in Honduras.
Among those freelance projects were point of sale systems, and live audio streaming and visualization
for radio stations. I did many different things besides software development,
I also ran a recording studio, radio station and a convention center and worked part time as a live sound engineer.  
I came to Sweden in 2014 and joined AFRY in 2018 as a Front-End Developer.  

**Why Sweden?**  
I get that question a lot... It's a long story, and not very fun, but I'll summarize it like this: I have zero hope that drug cartels would ever fairly govern Honduras. I returned to the US for a bit and while I was there I did some research and looked for consistently high marks in categories where my country has been poorly ranked. Of all the top results, I took a chance on Sweden. After more than six years of starting from zero in this country, I can really see myself living here for the rest of my life, doing exactly what I do now and feeling at home.

### Why AFRY?
It did take some time to get into the Swedish job market but eventually someone thought it would be good to hire one 
developer to take over development and maintenance of an app instead of continuing to hire a Danish firm for the same 
task but the challenge was that it had to be done in half the time. Even though I was unproven in Sweden, 
they gave me a chance based on that challenge and it worked out well. That's how I got my first job here,
working at Länstyrelsen Skåne (Full-Stack) doing some graphic design, photography and videography and exhibition design. 

I prototyped several apps for nature reserves, one which was shown during the Openhack hackathon at AFRY.
It was built using a serverless MongoDB back-end. However, I had been doing this on my own for two years I really 
wanted to grow and work with other enthusiastic and curious developers. I really got such a good impression during the
hackathon that I started with ÅF/AFRY just a couple of months afterwards.  

**Why front-end?**  
I prefer working on the Front-End because the end result is directly manipulated as a tool by the end-user and this 
is very satisfying to me as a creator.  
Because of my design background, I'm very close to the visuals, and the user 
experience. Far too many projects skip UX in the initial phase (or entirely) and usually this results in a big (expensive) 
miss.  
With AFRY, I've had the chance to identify such scenarios and flip the situation around to save the client time 
and resources by discussing user journeys as soon as possible and using those as a guide throughout the project.   
I also find it fun to use my game design background by creating simulations early on with realistic data.  
The user gets unique 
features from this early prototyping and stakeholders can breathe a sigh of relief when they actually see things working 
and are able to follow the user journey from start to finish.

## What are you doing at AFRY  
I've always taken Front-End roles: worked for _Volvo, inUse, Lequa, Teleservice, MaxIV Lab,_ and _Arvato_.  
Currently I'm working working with a huge IKEA Project with 50 other developers!  

Before that, I started to work on a new version of the "AFRY Digital Signage App" that you'll see at the entrance (coming to all LCD screens near you soon) with a small yet capable in-house team. It is really cool to work on that!

**I know that you're doing at least one more thing at AFRY**  
Yes that's true, I drive the Front-End Competence Group, since the beginning of competence groups. Rather than having a set task I prefer to see it as an app accelerator, like a "startup accelerator". So basically come in with an app idea that you'd like to see true and we'll help each-other out!  
Currently some of us are looking at the AFRY Signage and fixing the last small pieces and also the new Competence Blog.  
I have found that quickly building small apps ourselves is a very good way to understand the full-stack dev experience and test new technologies that we may not get to try during our usual assignments. We always have stack-overflow but it's much better to have someone there to help when you have questions or are looking for feedback. So, this group is there to satisfy that need, and to make sure your app will be a satisfying experience for the user.  
This is a good chance to learn from each other outside work-hours without any pressure.

## Enough work, what are your hobbies?
I still enjoy going around and seeing the sights, taking a walk or riding a bike through the many parks in the city or anywhere really. If I must stay indoors, I'll play the occasional videogame or find something entertaining or informative to watch or listen to.  
I like photography, making music, flying quads when it's not so windy. I lift weights and and then finally I really love to code and make apps or games.  

**Can you give me an example of something you've done?**  
Among them a _Lemonade Stand Simulator_, inspired by one of the games that came with the now legendary Apple II Computer which I got to experience during computer class.  
Also a game called [_Defend_](https://appsco.pe/app/defend) which is something I created soon after I started at AFRY. The game in its essence is a 3D Tower Defense but what makes it unique, is that your stronghold is in the middle and you could be attacked from all sides, so the survival strategy here is quite different. It was fun to code some artificial intelligence and consider projectile ballistics and physics.  
In terms of UX, integrating the resource counters into the actual scene instead of the old boring numerical display was quite a fun challenge. Another unique aspect is that all graphics and sound are procedurally generated from code, so the total filesize is actually quite small!  
I'm hoping to someday be able to leverage WebGL especially now that AR/VR is becoming commercially viable.

## I can't help it but I really want to wind back to the Signage Project as it's in-house, could you tell us a bit more?
The AFRY Digital Signage project is really close to me.  
It is the first time I have had the chance to work in-house and I must say it has been really fun! Even though I'm on a full-time assignment with IKEA, I want to keep working on it.  
To start a project from scratch is really fantastic and quite a rare opportunity, and moreover to do it with very motivated and knowledgeable colleagues. With such a good team clicking, we were able to be more ambitious and we got to to see the reaction from some of the stakeholders just a couple of weeks from project start when they got to use the prototype. This was truly rewarding and a big motivator to make it even better. 

If you want to know more, we would be happy to show the source code and talk about the development during the Front-End Competence group meetings.

**Thanks for letting us get some insights of who you are!**  
Thank you! I'm looking forward to reading about all of you soon!
