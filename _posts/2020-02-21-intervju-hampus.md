Welcome to our first interview/'meet X' where Hampus Londögård (see image above) is the first candidate, with more coming.  
As this is the first one we'll keep it light and please come with feedback on what type of questions we should ask!

### Quick Introduction
I'm Hampus Londögård, 25 years living in Lund and working at AFRY for a secret client.  I've been working at AFRY for almost 2 years now and also did my Master Thesis before that at AFRY.   When I'm not working I usually find myself either working out, watching TV, at AWs or programming some private project.

As a side note,I love both Kotlin & Natural Language Processing (which means that you structure data out of natural language), so if you have any ideas or something you'd like to discuss I want in!

### What are you doing at AFRY
At AFRY I'm doing a few different things outside of my assignment.
#### What is your assigment again?
I'm currently at a secret customer, unfortunately I can't tell you what I do (unless I get a Neuralyzer, like in Men In Black).
#### You mentioned that you do other things also at AFRY?
Yes!  
I'm a driver for the Competence Group that focuses on Machine Learning, Data Mining & Deep Learning where we have one meeting per month approximately. The meeting is pretty much like a workshop that goes on for ~ 3h and includes some food.  
We do everything from categorize text as different categories to generate text (putting our "poet hats" on and let the computer give us a poem). 
#### Anything else up your sleeves?
Yepp, I'm together with Hassan Ftouni responsible for competence at AFRY South Digital Solution. This task includes a lot of things, such as find interesting keynotes for our "Cozy Office Day"'s (we've a schedule set up for this spring, so stay tuned!).  
It also means that we're here to help you if you'd like to take a certificate, go to a conference or perhaps start your own Competence Group.  
Finally we're responsible for Tipsrundan, these interviews & our blog.

### You mentioned side projects, got any examples?
Yeah, a few too many ;)  

I'll try to keep it short, even though it is sometimes hard. My main project right now is to have a backend written in Kotlin using `ktor` (which btw is an awesome library for backends in Kotlin). Using this backend I want to be able to show off some of my projects, and as it runs on a Raspberry Pi I have to keep focus on having clever optimizations (as the JVM in combination with NLP tends to get expensive quickly). A Language Model can easily take multiple GBs which for sure don't fit into the RAM of a small Pi.  
It's really fun to be able to have small usable demos of the project, and to open-source with the possibility to also include them in their code as a library. By doing this you get a bit of everything, create a well-defined library with good APIs takes a bit of an effort.
 
For the interested most of my projects can be found under this GitHub: [londogard](https://github.com/londogard) but some are available directly under me: [Lundez](https://github.com/Lundez?tab=repositories).

And the website (even though really bad hehe) is available [here](https://londogard.com).

### Any final words?
If you'd like to join in on the Competence Evenings or think that any of my side projects sounds fun please reach out.  

Thanks for meeting me!

**Outro**  
We'd love to get feedback on how we can improve these interviews ("meet X") and perhaps which types of questions & what format would work better.
