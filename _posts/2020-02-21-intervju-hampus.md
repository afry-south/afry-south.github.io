Welcome to our first interview/'meet X' where Hampus Londögård (see image above) is the first candidate, with more coming.  
As this is the first one we'll keep it light and please come with feedback on what type of questions we should ask!

### Quick Introduction
I'm Hampus Londögård, 25 years living in Lund and working at AFRY for a secret client.  I've been working at AFRY for almost 2 years now and also did my Master Thesis before that at AFRY.   When I'm not working I usually find myself either working out, watching TV from the sofa, on AWs or programming some private project.

As a side note,I love both Kotlin & Natural Language Processing (which means that you structure data out of natural language), so if you have any ideas or something you'd like to discuss I want in!

### What are you doing at AFRY
At AFRY I'm doing a few different things outside of my assignment.
#### Assignment
As mentioned, secret customer.
#### Competence Group Driver: Machine Learning (NLP)
I'm a driver for the Competence Group that focuses on Machine Learning, Data Mining & Deep Learning where we have one meeting per month approximately. The meeting is pretty much like a workshop that goes on for ~ 3h and includes some food.  
We do everything from categorize text as different categories to generate text (putting our "poet hats" on and let the computer give us a poem). 
#### Competence Responsible at AFRY South Digital Solutions
I'm, together with Hassan Ftouni, the responsible party for competence at AFRY South Digital Solution. This means that I'm helping out to gather people to have presentations during our "Cozy Office Day"'s (we've a schedule set up for this spring, so stay tuned!) where we try to have different types of topics that are interesting. 

We're also here to help you if you'd like to take a certificate, go to a conference or perhaps start your own Competence Group - ask us and we'll help you.

### You mentioned side projects, got any examples?
Yeah, there's a few.  
Currently I'm in the process to have a backend written in Kotlin using `ktor` which is an awesome library for backends in Kotlin. Using this backend I want to be able to show off some of my projects, and as it runs on a Raspberry Pi I have to keep focus on having clever optimizations (as the JVM in combination with NLP tends to get expensive quickly). A Language Model easily takes multiple GBs which for sure don't fit into the RAM of a small Pi.  
It's really fun to be able to show & have people use the projects while at the same time delivering them as libraries to be downloaded for anyone. You've to think about a little of everything.  
 
For the interested most of my projects can be found under this GitHub: [londogard](https://github.com/londogard) but some are available directly under me: [Lundez](https://github.com/Lundez?tab=repositories).

And if you think it'd be fun to join in, just reach out and we can figure something out! :D
