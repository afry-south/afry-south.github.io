### Meet Dennis Londögård
##### Who are you?


### Meet Nellie Carleke
Hi everybody!
I’m from the beautiful and windy city Karlskrona in Blekinge. I moved to Lund six years ago to study Medicine. After memorizing enzymes and body parts in Latin for some time, I realized I missed math, physics and programming. Said and done, I dropped out of medical school and started to study Engineering Physics at LTH. I graduated last spring, so after a long and relaxing summer I’m really looking forward to start working here!
When I’m not by the computer I like to exercise, especially racket sports. I have played tennis since I could walk and started with table tennis and badminton when I was a teen. Nowadays I mostly play squash and like everybody else, it seems, I’ve also begun to play padel.
