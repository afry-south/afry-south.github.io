### Meet Dennis Londögård

##### Who are you?


### Meet Nellie Carleke
Hi everybody!

I’m from the beautiful and windy city Karlskrona in Blekinge. I moved to Lund six years ago to study Medicine. After memorizing enzymes and body parts in Latin for some time, I realized I missed math, physics and programming. Said and done, I dropped out of medical school and started to study Engineering Physics at LTH. I graduated last spring, so after a long and relaxing summer I’m really looking forward to start working here!

When I’m not by the computer I like to exercise, especially racket sports. I have played tennis since I could walk and started with table tennis and badminton when I was a teen. Nowadays I mostly play squash and like everybody else, it seems, I’ve also begun to play padel.

### Meet Oscar Odenstål
Hello everybody at IT south Malmö!  

I am one of the office’s new recruits and am so happy to be! It has been a bit of a special onboarding process due to the current circumstances but it has worked out well. 
Special thanks to my team for a warm welcoming.  

I come from just outside Lund and have just finished studying Computer Science this spring. I have spent most of the summer on the golf course or on my bike. If anyone is up for either a round of golf or a bike ride please reach out! :D  

The programming have followed me throughout my studies and on various extra jobs on the side. Mainly JS and Python have been used but also some Java.  
I am so happy to be here and look forward to meeting you all at the office (or on MS Teams) in the near future!
