## Welcome to AFRY IT South Blog

Here we'll post our own internal blogs that aims to either A) spread competence/knowledge or B) just share some fun awesome thing you just did.  
We'll also post our internal interviews ('meet').  

As there's no point in keeping this secret we decided to keep it public.

Hope you enjoy!
