## Tags & Categories

Posts can have both tags and categories where the former is a bit more "open" and the latter is more "closed". Categories builds the path to the blog-post, so having "Machine-Learning" & "Competence" would give URL: `afry-south.github.io/pages/machine-learning/competence/POST_NAME`. 

We want to keep categories as relevant and broad as possible while still dividing the topics in a sensible manner. Feel free to ask Hampus Londögård to add a new Category. The current list of "approved" categories follows.

**Categories**
- Machine-Learning
- Competence
- Meet
- JVM
- Front-end
- Back-end
- Terminal
- Database
- Multiplatform

**Tags:**  
Feel free to add your own. But please make sure to first look if there's relevant tags for your post already so we don't end up with "HTML", "html", "Html" and so on...  
All tags that exists currently can be found [here](https://afry-south.github.io/tags/).

## TODOs

- [ ] Create one sup-page per Competence Group with more information
