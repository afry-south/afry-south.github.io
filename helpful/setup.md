# Setup: Innovation Day 2021 @ AFRY 

As this years Innovation Day is virtual it's helpful to make use of the best tooling available.

**Recommended Editor**
- [Jetbrains IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/) ([IntelliJ (JVM)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [PyCharm (Python)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Webstorm (JS/TS)](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) etc)
  - Includes a real-time collaboration tool for coding called [**Code with Me**](https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/), including audio/video chat.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Includes a real-time collaboration tool for coding called [**Live Share**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)

These are highly recommended because of the included real-time collaboration tools which enables pair-programming on a new level.

**Recommended Audio/Video chat**
- MS Teams
- Slack (we got premium, this works!)
- Code with Me (Jetbrains)


**Recommended Git**
- GitHub
  - Using our org `afry-south`.
  - GitHub has a free built-in CI solution called [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) which is really easy and good!


All of these tools are easily set up using the guide supplied by each editor. IntelliJ is great for the JVM as it bundles the JDK.
